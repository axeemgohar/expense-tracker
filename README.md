# React Expense Tracker
A simple expense tracker built using React, designed to help users track their expenses and manage their budgets.

This project is similar to the one taught by Maximillian Schwarzmuller in the Udemy course ["React - The Complete Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). I have extended the functionality of the app and developed the UI from scratch. Extended functionality includes local storage integration, interlinked filters and deleting expense items.
Below are the details:
